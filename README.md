# Hello!

Welcome to third and final Pokedex app. I created this app because i am not satisfied with the previous version (pokedoxx) and decide to remake the Pokedex.
You can view the app in [here](pokedex-xyz.netlify.app).

What can i do with this app?

✅ Randomized Pokedex page

✅ View Pokemon detail, stats, and moves

✅ Can catch Pokemon

Future update(s):

❌ An optional search feature! (It's around the corner)

❌ View items in Pokemon

## Used Technologies

This app created with `create-react-app`
This app used many technologies such as Emotion, Apollo, GraphQL, Typescript, Lottie, and Jest
